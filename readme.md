# 🚀 Logging Odyssey: Golang, Docker, Clouds, and Loki 🌌

## Embark on a Journey Through Logging Excellence! 🌟

Welcome to the "Logging Odyssey," a project designed to showcase a comprehensive logging pipeline, from the birth of logs in a Golang service to their celestial visualization in Loki. We'll traverse through containerization with Docker, tame log rotation with LogRotate, conquer cloud storage with S3, and finally, unveil our logs in the magnificent realm of Loki.

## 🌟 What Awaits You on This Odyssey? 🌟

* **Golang Log Genesis:** A simple yet powerful Golang service that breathes life into logs, with levels spanning from INFO to ERROR.
* **Docker's Starship:** Containerization with Docker, ensuring our service travels smoothly across any environment.
* **LogRotate's Time Capsule:** Log rotation with LogRotate, archiving our logs for future exploration.
* **Cloud's Celestial Vault (S3):** Archival in Amazon S3, storing our logs in the vast expanse of the cloud.
* **Loki's Cosmic Observatory:** Log monitoring with Loki, visualizing our logs with clarity and precision.

## 🛠️ Prepare for Launch! 🛠️

### 🚀 Prerequisites

* **Go (Golang):** The engine of our logging vessel.
* **Docker:** Our containerization starship.
* **AWS CLI:** Your gateway to the S3 cloud (or Azure CLI for Azure Blob).
* **Loki:** Our cosmic log observatory.
* **LogRotate:** Our log archiving tool.
